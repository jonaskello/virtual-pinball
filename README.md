This repo contains information about building a virtual pinball machine.

# Cabinet & Backbox

Original WPC style cabinet sketchup plans can be found [here](https://github.com/jonaskello/wpc-cabinet). In order to work as a virtual cabinet these plans will have to be customized. These items will affect the cabinet woodwork so they need to be determined before cutting the wood:

* Screens
* Buttons & External Connections
* Plunger
* Ventilation
* Speakers

# Screens

The screens are the most important parts because they are only avialble in certain fixed sizes. So the cabinet need to built to fit the screens which means we need to select screens before building the cabinet. In order to fully simulate a WPC pinball machine three screens are needed:

* Playfield screen
* Backglass screen
* DMD screen

## Playfield Screen

For the playfield screen we want to have as little input lag as possible, and the best viewing angle possible.

## Backglass Screen

The backglass screen just displays a static image so not sure what we need to consider here?

## Decasing

In order to fit screens they may have to be decased, which means the outer plastic is removed. Some screens have no internal metal holding the screen together so if it is opened it will break. So be careful when decasing.

## Screens to use

| Screen    | Model             | Size with bezel | Size decased | Resolution      | Link    |
|:--------- |:----------------- |:--------------- |:------------ |:--------------- |:------ |
| Playfield | Philips BDM4350UC | Unknown         | Unkown       | 4K (3840 x 2160) | [Link](http://www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/cpindex.pl?scy=PH&slg=EN&ctn=BDM4350UC/00).                                  |
| Backglass | Philips BDM4350UC | Unknown         | Unkown       | 4K (3840 x 2160) | [Link](http://www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/cpindex.pl?scy=PH&slg=EN&ctn=BDM4350UC/00).                                  |
| DMD       | Philips BDM4350UC | Unknown         | Unkown       | 4K (3840 x 2160) | [Link](http://www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/cpindex.pl?scy=PH&slg=EN&ctn=BDM4350UC/00).                                  |

# Plunger

TODO!

# Ventilation

Fans in the cabinet bottom at the front to take in air, and fans at the cabinet back to exhaust air. 

# Speakers

Some really nice information about pinball speaker replacement can be found [here](http://dziedzic.us/wpc_speaker_replacement.html).

For games with a wooden display panel with a dot matrix display purchase a pair of 5-1/4 inch coaxial speakers. Back box speakers should be 4 ohm impedance and be rated to handle at least 25 watts RMS power.

 Go with woofer that has the best low-end response. Look for a low frequency response of at least 35 Hz; a smaller number is better here. Purchase a woofer rated to handle at least 25 watts RMS. 

Since we're replacing the existing "wide range" cabinet speaker with a woofer we'll want to ensure that only low frequency sounds are sent to the cabinet speaker. Pre-assembled subwoofer crossover.

# Speaker Panel

As mentioned [here](https://nickpinball.wordpress.com/tag/virtual-cabinet/), to get an authentic feel, purchase a Williams original speaker panel as avaialble [here](http://www.ministryofpinball.com/en/wpc95-speaker-panel-with-chrome-williams-logo.html).

To mount the speaker panel we need:

* Bottom bracket
* Top H bracket
* Mounting brackets in the backbox

# Internal Power Connectors

* Surge Protector

# PC

## Case

For mounting the PC we don't need a full case. An open "test bench case" as used [here](http://thingsnotleftunsaid.blogspot.se/2015/06/virtual-pinball-machine-build_30.html) will be enough and maybe better from a cooling standpoint. Some examples:
