# Screens

The screens are the most important parts because they are only avialble in certain fixed sizes. So the cabinet need to built to fit the screens which means we need to select screens before building the cabinet.

* Playfield screen
* Backglass screen
* DMD screen

# Speaker Panel

As mentioned [here](https://nickpinball.wordpress.com/tag/virtual-cabinet/), to get an authentic feel, purchase a Williams original speaker panel as avaialble [here](http://www.ministryofpinball.com/en/wpc95-speaker-panel-with-chrome-williams-logo.html).

To mount the speaker panel we need:

* Bottom bracket
* Top H bracket
* Mounting brackets in the backbox

# Speakers

Some really nice information about pinball speaker replacement can be found [here](http://dziedzic.us/wpc_speaker_replacement.html).

For games with a wooden display panel with a dot matrix display purchase a pair of 5-1/4 inch coaxial speakers. Back box speakers should be 4 ohm impedance and be rated to handle at least 25 watts RMS power.

 Go with woofer that has the best low-end response. Look for a low frequency response of at least 35 Hz; a smaller number is better here. Purchase a woofer rated to handle at least 25 watts RMS. 

Since we're replacing the existing "wide range" cabinet speaker with a woofer we'll want to ensure that only low frequency sounds are sent to the cabinet speaker. Pre-assembled subwoofer crossover.

# PC

## Case

For mounting the PC we don't need a full case. An open "test bench case" as used [here](http://thingsnotleftunsaid.blogspot.se/2015/06/virtual-pinball-machine-build_30.html) will be enough and maybe better from a cooling standpoint. Some examples:
